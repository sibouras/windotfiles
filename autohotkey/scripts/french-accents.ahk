/*
Easy accents on a qwerty keyboard including french ç as well as spanish ñ and ¿ 1nd ¡

Inspired a.o. by https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/16920-how-to-enter-basic-spanish-accented-characters/
Note: Obtained the unicode values at: https en.wikipedia.org /wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters  Broken Link for safety

Basiclly this solution allows to type any vowel followed by any of ['"\^] to obtain the 'accented' version:
' after [aeiou] produces [áéíóú]
" after [aeiou] produces [äëïöü]
\ after [aeiou] produces [àèìòù]
^ after [aeiou] produces [âêîôû]
' after [NnCc?!] procuces [ÑñÇç¿¡]

This approach requires extra care to enter a quote or single quote character as such after a vowel.
This is cared for by preceding ' or " with a space:
this sequence will be changed into a ' or " without the ledig space.

Note: I use the \ key to issue an ` accent, because it is available
on my US Apple keyboard as an extra key between the single/double quotes key and the return key.
This is just a personal lazy solution, the real ` key could be used as well.
